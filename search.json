I kind of like it to show the fruit’s quality contrasting different quality attributing characters parameters. Although, its a huge process to wrangle the data for this graph but I liked it, and it can visualize beautifully. Another point to add about this graph. As I have added 3 spider graph in one row, so it look small but if I can zoom it then it becomes big and clear or if I will dynamically decrease the browser’s window size then the column of the spider graph automatically get one another and becomes bigger, which is really beautiful to look!\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing the normal tidyness of the excel file (available at data/raw.data folder), the comparatively cleaned file is then kept in the folder data/raw.data. Now lets input the data from the excel file to the rstudio.\n\n\n\nAs the data is now loaded in the environment we need to do a lot of sorting/wrangling to get the objectives. This document contains a lot of data. We need to wrangle the data to fulfill our objectives of the assignment as well as to visualize the data in a meaningful way. Here, I will select/wrangle/sort/clean only a few parameters. So, lets get started."
